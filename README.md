# QuantumComputing

🚀 Dive into the Quantum Realm

This repository contains the following projects:

- 🌌 <a href="https://github.com/Snafkin547/QuantumComputing/tree/main/QuantumML">Quantum Machine Learning</a>:Warp through quantum algorithms with this stellar project that channels the wisdom of Dr. Frank Zickert’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Quantum-Machine-Learning-Python/dp/B09786HQSB#:~:text=Hands%2DOn%20Quantum%20Machine%20Learning%20With%20Python%20strives%20to%20be,a%20practical%20and%20applied%20manner">“Hands-On Quantum Machine Learning With Python.”</a> It’s not just theory; it’s a universe of practice!


- 🍷<a href="https://github.com/Snafkin547/QuantumComputing/tree/main/BinaryClassification">Applied Quantum Machine Learning</a>:Take a quantum leap from theory to application! After sipping insights from the first project, we distilled them into a research concoction that could predict the quality of wine. It’s a binary classification challenge that marries quantum computing with viticulture, and the results are simply intoxicating!

Embark on this quantum journey where entangled qubits meet the finest grapes, and discover how the smallest particles can answer some of the biggest questions in winemaking!
